Homebrew rig design to provide cost efficient performance, flexibility and fun to home brewers.

Hi, my name is Matthias. 

The vision: Create a design for a home brewing rig that allows anyone to build a rig that performs well, that is adaptable to an increasing prefessionalism as the hombrewer progresses with the hobby, and that is cost efficient to build and maintain due to the use of internationally available standard parts.

I brew in my kitchen. I am an engineer. I like to build stuff. I want a an aparatus to brew. I have looked into what people have built. The breath and depth of solutions is amazing. While this is great, it also 'forces' new entrants into the hobby to either spend a ton of time researching and learning about the topic and to go through the learning curve largely again. 
Considerations such as cost, complexity, size, performance, adaptability etc. need to be weight, which can be quite a task for your typical homebrewer. 
There must be a sound design which we can 'cristallize' from all the know how out there. This design, including instructions, should enable anyone to specify, source, assemble and use a home-built brewing rig successfully. Ideally this design is built with a modularity and adaptibility in mind, allowing the newby to get started with a bare bone setup which can be updgraded increasingly to a more and more sophisticated brewing rig. It also should be a 'live' project which a design that improves over time as 'field' experience flows back into it.  

I am using GitHub - no idea how well it will work for an engineering project. Lets find out! Full disclosure - I am interested in brewing as well as developing and building this beast. I am also interested in exploring the possibilities to 'crowdsource' innovation, design and engineering. I therefore called it CloudBrewery.  

Lets see what we can do!
